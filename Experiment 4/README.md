Implementation of Iterative Control Structures using FOR, WHILE, and LOOP in PostgreSQL


Aim
To understand and implement iterative control structures in PostgreSQL conceptually, including FOR loops, WHILE loops, and basic LOOP constructs, for repeated execution of database logic.


Objectives
•	To understand why iteration is required in database programming
•	To learn the purpose and behavior of FOR, WHILE, and LOOP constructs
•	To understand how repeated data processing is handled in databases
•	To relate loop concepts to real-world batch processing scenarios
•	To strengthen conceptual knowledge of procedural SQL used in enterprise systems
